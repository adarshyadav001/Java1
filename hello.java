/*Static is a keyword that can be prefixed with-
1. Variables2. Method3. Block
Static Variables- 
class s1 = new keyword(s1)
class s2= new keyword(s2)
The static variable take a separate memory that will be shared by all the objects of class.
static variable can be accessed by any member of class
WAP to find number of objects in a class??
static member can be accesed by class name but it my also accessed by
Student s1= new student("Ravi");
Student s2= new student("Aditya");
Studnet s3= new studet("Rahul");
Student s4= new student("Abhi");

When static keyword is prefixed with any method of the class then the method is called static method,it can access only static member of same class directly
The function can be accessed by class name directly that's why when we execute any java program
